# Pusteblume - Diaspora Android App

Tested and compiled with Appcelerator Titanium SDK 3.5.0 GA and Android 5

If you prefer a native html wrapper app have a look at https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android

---

This is not a webview/html app. It will take the json output and display it in native UI elements. Since there is no API it may not work in future Diaspora versions.

**At the moment there is no f-droid repo yet.**

But the binary is available at github: https://github.com/m1ga/pusteblume/releases
